# ROIIntensityTimeCourse

This script will record intensity in user-drawn ROIs over a time course.

Users should run the script and then select an image which contains a time course with a fixed position.

Users will be prompted to draw ROIs on the image, and the script will then save a table of mean intensities over time in each ROI and will save all ROIs in a separate folder.
